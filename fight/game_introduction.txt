6, play
Because I¡¯m studying how to use python, I¡¯m sorry that you cannot download it now.  You can copy the folder ¡®fight¡¯ on D drive, and put it into anther folder named ¡®python¡¯. It¡¯s important. Then you should open the terminal of the computer and write ¡®cd D:\python\fight¡¯, and then write¡¯ python D:\python\fight\main.py¡¯ to start the game. Click the button ¡®Play¡¯ and you can play the game. Welcome to give me some advice. Thanks.
